# Daily_schedule
Before starting my undergraduate studies, I had a pretty fixed daily schedule. I would attend classes for 45 minutes and take a 15-minute break afterward. However, during my PhD, I found myself sitting for extended periods without taking breaks, which negatively impacted my productivity and health. To remedy this, I created a tiny tool to remind me to take regular breaks.

The tool is programmed to ring a song "summer" on the 45th minute of each hour, signaling a 15-minute break. After the break, it plays a 1 min piano song to indicate that it's time to resume work. When the ring is ringing, you can press the "Esc" key to skip it if needed. Otherwise, pressing the "Esc" key will skip rings for 2 hours.

To prevent any disturbances, the tool will not ring before 10:00 am or after 23:00 pm. 

Additionally, you can set a .bat file to automatically start the program when starting the computer.
